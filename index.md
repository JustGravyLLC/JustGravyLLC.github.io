  <h2>About</h2>

  <p><strong>Just Gravy LLC</strong> was founded to design, develop, and license <em>Compile</em>, a small-box dueling card game with deep replayability and dozens of evocative card sets.</p>

  <p>Just Gravy has made other, less popular games in the past — and will make other, more popular games in the future.</p>

  <p>Just Gravy LLC is a sole proprietorship owned by Michael Yang (the “I” above).</p>

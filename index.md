# About

Just Gravy LLC was founded to design, develop, and license Compile, a small-box dueling card game with tons of replayability and dozens of evocative sets of cards.
Just Gravy has made other, less popular games in the past, and will make other, more popular, games in the future.
Just Gravy LLC is a sole proprietorship owned by Michael Yang (the 'I' above).

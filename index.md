  <h3>About</h3>

  <p><strong>Just Gravy LLC</strong> was founded to design, develop, and license <em>Compile</em>, a small-box dueling card game that's easy to table but has lots of layers of reward for repeated play. Compile: Main 1, Aux 1, Main 2, and Aux 2 are on sale now.</p>

  <p>Just Gravy has made other, less popular games in the past — and will make other, more popular games in the future.</p>

  <p>Just Gravy LLC is owned and operated by Michael Yang (the “I” above).</p>
